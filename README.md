# Cardiovascular Mortality - Race/Ethnicity - 2023

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate estimates of cardiovascular mortality in the United States by state, year, age, sex, and race/ethnicity as reported in 'State-Level Cardiovascular Mortality Rates Among Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Black, and Non-Hispanic White Populations, 1990 to 2019' published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on March 15th, 2023. 

* The folder 'crabcorrect' contains code to produce final results by adjusting cause-specific mortality estimates for each race/ethnicity group to ensure that the race/ethnicity-specific deaths for each state sum to the number of state-level deaths from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study.
